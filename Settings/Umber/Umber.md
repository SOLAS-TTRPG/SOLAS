# Umber
**A World Worn by Time, Guided by Ideals**

In Umber, the echoes of ancient empires and forgotten gods linger beneath every stone and shadow. Magic is real but rare, and the line between good and evil is blurred by the weight of history and human ambition. Adventurers seek to do good (or gain) in a world scarred by the passage of time, where the ruins of past glory stand as reminders that even the greatest ideals can falter. With expanded character customization and a focus on gritty, personal stories, Umber strikes a balance between the mythic grandeur of high fantasy and the grounded, dangerous allure of sword and sorcery.

# Mechanics
Characters are created using the standard SOLAS method. However, there are a few new options to keep in mind when doing so: spellcasting, as well as additional abilities, called Boons.

## Spells
There is magic out the world, and some have the ability to control it. As for you (if you have a Mind score of at least two), you have this gift. Spells and arcane prowess are generally controlled by your character's **Mind** ability.

Characters can have a certain amount of prepared spells equal to their Mind. Most spellcasters have some way of keeping track of the spells they've encountered and learned, but due to the immense mental strain can only have a few ready at any given moment. The spells you have prepared are the ones that you can cast.

Spells have a certain cost, being **one stamina** as well as a **focus cost**.

## Boons
As your character becomes more experienced in what they do, they can specialize in how they approach challenges. When your character reaches level two (don't forget to put a point into one of your abilities) you can select a boon, as long as you meet the ability minimum.
