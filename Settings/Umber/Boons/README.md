# Boons
As your ability grows, you gain boons: unique abilities that shape how you can interact with the world. You select a boon at level one, and every three levels after that (four, seven, ten, etc.).

Boons are designed for either martials (physical fighters) or spellcasters, and each are written to benefit from multiple abilities. These are just suggestions, and any boon can be taken by anyone with at least a two in the ability category they belong to. Get creative!

Some boons have upgrades that can be taken later on in the game. When you have an opportunity to select a boon, you can elect to upgrade one that you already have instead.
