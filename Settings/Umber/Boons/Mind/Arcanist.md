**Magic is an art form. A dangerous one**

Your maximum number of known spells is increased by your Dexterity.

## Inspiring Arcanist
On your turn, you can spend a focus point to give an ally one of your stamina points.

## Tinkering Arcanist
Once per rest, you can imbue a non-magical item with one of your memorized spells. Until your next rest, you are able to cast that spell from the object, as long as it is within short range (20 feet). The spells still cost a stamina and the standard focus cost.
