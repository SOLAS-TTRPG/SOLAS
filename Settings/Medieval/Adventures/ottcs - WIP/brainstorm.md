# Purpose
A multi-shot that introduces players to the mechanics present in the medieval fantasy setting, as well as SOLAS in general. Additionally, it should provide interaction points for the established lore in the world.

**Mechanics present**

- Leveling and Boons - this is solved because it's a multi-shot
- Spellcasting - people should take these boons because they're interesting

**Lore Present**

- Elves are seafaring - ocean campaigns are VERY tough though so maybe just port interaction
- Gobs - probably living in port for all of the sun, basically just perma-vacation
- Faunari - Trading crossroads as a midpoint somewhere?
- Orcs - traveling through forest on the way to deep mountain entrance
- Dwarves - deep mountain destination
