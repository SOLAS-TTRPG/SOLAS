**Up close and personal**

Your maximum number of known spells is increased by your **Strength**. Additionally, choose an elemental (Acid, Poison, Fire, Cold, Lightning) or celestial damage (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic) type to be **resistant** to. You cannot change this type after you've selected this boon.

# Upgrades
When you reach a level where you can select a new boon, you can instead opt to take one of the upgrades below. Upgrades are not exclusive.

## Imbued
If you are attacked by your chosen damage type, you recover **one Focus** afterward, regardless if the attack succeeds or fails. Your next attack with that damage type is rolled with advantage.

## Smite
When you make a melee attack, you can choose to spend **two focus** to add additional damage of your previously selected type, equal to the successes of a **Mind Check**.

# Spells
The [Evoker](Evoker.md) Spell List is as follows:

## Apprentice Spells
**Requires Two Mind | Costs Two Focus**

## Fear
You choose a number of targets (up to your Strength) within close range to become frightened of you. There are three options they may take: fight, flight, or freeze. Fight locks them into moving towards you, and they are forced to attack. Flight locks them into moving away from you, with no attacks against you. Freeze completely locks their movement, and they cannot use any actions on their turn.

## Telekinesis
You can apply a push or pull force within short range. By spending **one focus and one stamina**, you can move a target up to 5 feet per success of a strength check. If the target attempts to resist it, they roll a strength check which reduces your successes.
