**An Ancient World, Worn by Time**



In Umber, the echoes of ancient empires and forgotten gods linger beneath ruins and cities alike. Most people have some sort of magical tendency, but deep study leads to suspicion of others, as well as vice versa. Adventurers are common, but most treat it as an income stream rather than grand, altruistic quests. The passage of time has rendered the greatest monuments and ideals down to nothing more than old twisted ruins, standing alone and forgotten.

With expanded character abilities and spells, Umber lends a focus to more personal stories, finding a balance between high fantasy and sword and sorcery.

# Mechanics
Characters are created using the standard SOLAS method. However, there are a few new options to keep in mind when doing so: Races, Spellcasting, and additional abilities called Boons.

## Races
You can choose this at any point of the character creation process. Whether you think of a character first and then create the stats around them or vice versa, here are your options:

### Humans
Massively adaptable, and able to make their way wherever they end up. They conquered much in the past, but ideas of the Old World have been long forgotten by now. Most humans have taken to running establishments or adventuring, just like the rest of the world. But a small spark of inspiration remains buried deep in some Humans, leading them down curious paths.

### Dwarves
One of the oldest races (in terms of history and how long they live), stay primarily underground, where their steady improvement of metalworking allows them to create tools, weapons, and contraptions that can baffle even the most studied of the surface-dwellers (everyone else). Standing around four feet tall, they also have exceptionally pale hair and skin, ruby-red eyes, and lower centers of gravity which lend them well to defensive combat tactics. Dwarven cities were established long ago along the banks of underground rivers, and as the water slowly eroded the cavern floor deeper and deeper, the Dwarves began carving more and more establishments into the walls of the ever-deepening ravine. Most Dwarves have never seen the sun or the oceans, and don't get why elves like them so much.

### Elves
Originating from a log-sunken island chain dense in natural magic, most have stuck to the seas and the shores that frame them. They have warm skin tones ranging from tan to dark coffee, vary wildly in height from four and a half to six and a half feet tall, and have normal-sized but pointed ears. Despite so much variation, they still agree on the importance and beauty of the sun and the oceans. And that Dwarven cities are probably the worst.

### Faunari
Nomadic folk with hooved goat legs, permitting them navigation of difficult terrain from steep mountains to forest undergrowth. They sport horns that range from swept-back antelope to large, curling ram shapes. Their varied skin hues come from the environments they were born in, from ashen gray hues in mountains, to fiery red in deserts, deep green in forests, even pure white in tundras. The Faunari form roaming kin-clans that can create temporary settlements, or _Glens_, at common crossroad areas where they trade, celebrate, and share stories as the population is ever arriving, ever leaving.

### Chlorophytes
Coming in both small and large sizes, these green-skinned, pointy-eared humanoids are more commonly described as goblins and/or orcs. Due to their ability to absorb sunlight to survive almost indefinitely without rations, they have both developed vastly different cultures than most other humanoids, as well as each other.

Orcs (somewhat tall, with small tusks and ranging from lithe to muscular) have taken to living in forests, swamps, or jungles, where they will build canopy bridge-networked towns. When adventuring outside of these towns, they'll typically pick up outdoor work. It's rewarding, and lets them keep their rations.

Goblins (heavyset, four feet tall, with large, floppy ears) have built a culture revolving around outdoor relaxation and festivals. They tend to settle in towns near bodies of freshwater, with their culture either bringing in other races for the parties, or getting themselves kicked out. They usually stay away from hard work when they can.

## Spells
There is magic out the world, and some have the ability to control it. As for you (if you have a Mind score of at least two), you have this gift. Spells and arcane prowess are generally controlled by your character's **Mind** ability.

Characters can only know a certain amount of spells equal to their Mind, due to the immense mental strain. Whenever your Mind is increased, you can elect to learn a new spell. Most wizards will teach spells for a fee (monetary or some spell components), or you might come across spellbooks to learn from.

Spells have a certain cost, being **one stamina** as well as the **focus cost** based on difficulty tier (beginner, intermediate, and advanced). Remember that you only get one Focus back at the start of each of your turns.

### Beginner Spells
**Requires Two Mind | Costs Two Focus**

**Calculated.** When you are making a **Mind Check**, you can improve your mental clarity, giving you advantage on the roll.

**Glow.** Causes a non-magical item that can be held in one hand to emit a faint light for up to an hour. Slowly fades over that course of time.

**Mage Hand.** You create an invisible hand within short range that can hold items up to five pounds. Every ability score it has is 0, except it has your Dexterity. It has **one Heart**. You can perform actions with this mage hand by expanding **one Focus**:

- **Move.** Up to a short distance
- **Act.** Make a check of your choice with it

**Spark.** You create a small flame by snapping, about the size of a candle's, which goes out after a few seconds. Good for starting a campfire or lighting torches, but technically deals **R1 Fire** to a melee target.

**Thaumaturgy.** You can create a harmless sensory effect within short range, such as flames flickering, the sound of indistinct whispers, and more. Gettin' spooky with it.

**Whisper.** You establish a mental connection with someone you can see within Short Range. For the next hour, either party can spend **One Focus** to send a mental whisper to the other, regardless of range or sight.

### Intermediate Spells
**Requires Four Mind | Costs Four Focus**

- WIP

### Advanced Spells
**Requires Six Mind | Costs Six Focus**

- WIP

## Boons
As your character becomes more experienced in what they do, they can specialize in how they approach challenges. **When your character reaches level two** (don't forget to put a point into one of your abilities) you can select a boon, as long as you meet the ability minimum. You get to select an additional boon (or select a upgrade to one that you have, listed on the Boon's document) every three levels after this. That means levels 2, 5, 8, 11, and so on. There isn't a maximum level.

# Adventures
Below are the adventures which have been created for this module.

- These are a work in progress! It takes a lot of time to cook these up, not to mention playtesting. I'll be bringing in a module that is under construction soon, an arctic expedition with a Lovecraftian twist.

# World Lore and History
Umber is an **old** world, but most of its history has been long erased or forgotten. While powerful warring kingdoms once conquered all they could, something happened that wiped out most of the world's urban. A century or two later is where we find ourselves now, after all who cared to go looking into the capital ruins never came back, and everybody else forgot exactly what happened anyway.

This world is round, but as it wobbles awkwardly around its sun-facing north pole, it maintains its very unique climate: the icy tundra around its pole is bathed in a permanent twilight. A massive ocean surrounds the icy, polar mass, its waves broken up by huge continents sitting a good distance off of the pole, reaching out to each other with broken, scattered archipelagos.

The environments of the continents are fairly consistent: stony, rocky bits towards their northern edges, trailing off into plains, forests, and your standard fare of biomes. Beyond a hundred miles or so from this more habitable are the farlands: inconsistent and dangerous, everything from toxic swamps whose sizes rival those of the long forgotten countries to volcanic carving their way through scorched landscapes. There is little rhyme, reason, nor consistency, which is part of the reason why there aren't reliable maps of the areas. But adventurers hardly go out there anyway. Nobody is out there to do work for.

The ruined capitals which dot the continents range from nearly perfectly-preserved ghost towns to rubble, slowly sinking into whatever is below them. Most tend to avoid them, and nobody who goes looking comes back. The only ones who would have a recollection would be the Dwarves, whose chasmic underground cities didn't collapse along with the ones on the surface. As the oldest among them will be happy to tell adventurers over a mug:

>Heh. That's what the sky and oceans'll do to ya. Don't muck about with 'em like those Elves do, they're just asking for a second round. Speaking of which...

Unfortunately, this logic doesn't hold up when considering the Elves, seafaring and archipelago-hopping, they've got their own thoughts on the events:

>Those cities were gettin' too crowded and stale. Who stays in one place forever? Most people are wanderers at heart. Except for Dwarves, I s'pose - they've got a thing for digging into the same old spot.

The others outside the cities (Faunari, Chlorophytes, and rural-dwelling Humans) don't have too much to say on it, as the ones ones who were curious enough already went and vanished into what was left, looking for answers. Each has their own version of a cautionary tale to tell about it, none with any more truth than the others.

The world is a calmer place now. Larger towns are as big as civilization gets on the surface, and adventurers commonly go between them looking for work.
