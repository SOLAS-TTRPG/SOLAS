Casters need to be dependent on their secondary stats

Allowing the spell lists to be expanded by their secondary stat is good, but there needs to be more.

## Casters

Con Casters can spend heart to scale spells to be more powerful, or have spells that rely on concentration. Casters should not be dealing crazy damage, because they are likely the longest-lived class.

Str Casters could grant themselves advantage on melee attacks and added damage(/reduction)

Dex caster spells should deal damage something like R(1 + Dex), just scaling as you get more "accurate"

## Ranged
*Both dex boons and the con/dex boon*

### Ranger - Active Dex
When you make a ranged attack that reduces a creature's heart to 0 or below, you instantly recover one stamina point. (Enables cool moments where the stamina cost for reloading is offset so that you can get off a couple shots in quick succession.)

### Rogue - Sniper
When you make a ranged attack, you can spend **One Focus** to impede the creature's movement. Roll a **Mind Check**, each success being 5 feet less that they can travel when moving until the end of your next turn.

### Hunter
