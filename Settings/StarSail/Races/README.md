## Sibilants
**hisssssss**

In two words: reptile people. The actual build of these people is quite large, tending towards six and a half feet tall on average. With soft, flexible scales on their limbs where humans have arm/leg hair, Sibilants typically have relatively human physiques, outside of their snakelike skull shapes and slightly longer necks. Also their tails that drag on the ground behind them.
