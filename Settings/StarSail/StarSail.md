# StarSail
**Space. Space. Gotta go to sPAAAAAAAAACE**

StarSail is a science fiction setting, focusing on planetary exploration, space battles, and everything in-between.

The universe has had quite a few galactic rushes, and this one is nothing new. Every hundred years or so, there's a big spike in adventurers braving the void to land on interesting (or new) planets, and meet interesting (and new) people. Unfortunately, this also tends to increase the amount of piracy.

There's no "galactic federation" of sorts. Simply a few large, interplanetary corporations that typically avoid anything too openly malicious to keep their products selling and investors happy.

**name** is a corporation focused on the manufacturing of heavy machinery, used primary in mining operations, though a decent number of hangar staples can be seen sporting their logo. While their mining operation on **WIP** has long run dry, the layers of scaffolding, and machinery construct a pseudo-skeleton for the hollow, tunneled rock that keeps it from collapsing. Now having moved their offices to **WIP**
