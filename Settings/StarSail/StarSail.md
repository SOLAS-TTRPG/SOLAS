# StarSail
**Space. Space. Gotta go to sPAAAAAAAAACE**

StarSail is a science fiction setting, focusing on planetary exploration, space battles, and everything in-between.

The universe has had quite a few galactic rushes, and this one is nothing new. Every hundred years or so, there's a big spike in adventurers braving the void to land on interesting (or new) planets, and meet interesting (and new) people. Unfortunately, this also tends to increase the amount of piracy.

There's no "galactic federation" of sorts. Simply a few large, interplanetary corporations that typically avoid anything too openly malicious to keep their products selling and investors happy.

**COMPANY NAME 001** is a corporation focused on the manufacturing of heavy machinery, used primary in mining operations, though a decent number of hangar staples can be seen sporting their logo. While their mining operation on **WIP** has long run dry, the layers of scaffolding, and machinery construct a pseudo-skeleton for the hollow, tunneled rock that keeps it from collapsing. Now having moved their offices to **WIP**

# Ships
Ships have stats in the four main abilities, as normal. A basic ship has a 1 in each stat (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Mind). To upgrade a ship, you must spend the amount to go up to the new total (going from a total of 5 to a total of six costs 3k). Once you do this, you may choose an ability score to add 1 point to.

| Abilities Total | Cost |
| --------------- | ---- |
| 4 (Base)        | 20k  |
| 5               | 2k   |
| 6               | 3k   |
| 7               | 5k   |
| 8               | 8k   |
| 9               | 13k  |
| 10              | 21k  |

## Components
A ship has two categories of components, engines and tech. Engines are covered by Strength (controls your maximum speed) and Dexterity (controls your evade). Tech is covered by Constitution (controls your Shields) and Mind (controls your storeable energy).

**Strength.** You can increase/decrease your current speed by up to your strength score

## Weapons
Additionally, you may add weapons to your ship. As a rule of thumb, weapons deal R2 damage per energy spent. Light weapons deal R2 and cost 1 energy, Medium weapons deal R4 and cost 2 energy, and Heavy weapons deal R6 and cost 3 energy.

Each time you fire a weapon on your turn, the next weapon firing is rolled at disadvantage, until the start of your next turn.

## Combat
When at rest, your shields charge up to 4 \* Constitution. This is the maximum you can attain.

When it is your group's turn in combat, your ship generates 3 energy. You can use this energy to restore shields, or temporarily increase your Strength or Dexterity. If you do not use energy points by the end of your turn, you may store excess (up to your Mind score) in the ship's capacitors for use on a later turn.

When damage is dealt to a ship, reduce the ship's shields first. If there are 0 shields and there is still damage to be dealt, critical damage occurs. The attacker rolls a dice, the outcome determined below:

| Roll | Result            |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 1    | Defender's choice |
| 2    | Strength 0        |
| 3    | Dexterity 0       |
| 4    | Constitution 0    |
| 5    | Mind 0            |
| 6    | Attacker's Choice |

# Armor
Normal strength requirements are in place. However, armor can be built to withstand specific damage types, not just physical.
