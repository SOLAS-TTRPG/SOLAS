# Crossroads
What was once a lonely, derelict set of planets circling a white dwarf, began to see some traction as rudimentary pit stops once a few systems around had fairly regular merchant, smuggler, and pleasure cruisers moving between, and needed a pit stop. Crossroads only has four planets, the closest and furthest ones having climates that are not survivable for any extended duration.
