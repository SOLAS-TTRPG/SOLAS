**The Charred One**

Sitting just too close to the star, this half-molten sphere has a cracking, shifting surface, revealing miles wide gaps between cooled continents on the slowly revolving surface. These continents are not stable, and will shrink and melt when facing the sun, only for new ones to form from the molten sea as it cools on the dark hemisphere. No successful settlements have been formed here obviously, though a few research vessels have landed on the dark side to do research for the week-long night the fresh continents experience before vanishing.
