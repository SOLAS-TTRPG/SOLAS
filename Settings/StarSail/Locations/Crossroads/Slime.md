# Slime
**The Chilly One**

Slime has a dense, wet atmosphere that keeps daytime overcast at its most pleasant. With a flat, stony surface, plants or other life never flourished here on its own, but it does provide an easy place for landing in an emergency.

There are several tunnel colonies on this planet, all with similar cultural climates. Races that prefer it cool and damp tend here, which is what ended up giving the planet its nickname. As a result, there are quite a few Sibilants who live here and work as mechanics, warehouse operators for cargo dropoffs, and more. It's not a vacation destination, but it's a great pit-stop if your ship didn't fare well in a fight.
