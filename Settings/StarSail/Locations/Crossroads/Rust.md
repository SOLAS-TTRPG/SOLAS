**The Warm One**

While sand covers the surface of this planet, iron-rich dust and underground generate an insanely protective electromagnetic field around the planet to block radiation, but will mess with cheap electronics. A few ships have crashed on it over the centuries, leading to one or two temporary (and now vacant) hodgepodge settlements built out of the hulls. Nothing grows here, it's just sand.
