# [Rage](Rage.md)
On your turn (if you are not wearing armor), you can use **One Focus** to rage. While raging, you have advantage on all strength checks and strength-based melee attacks, but you do not recover spent focus. Your rage ends when you do not take damage from the start of one turn to the end of the next.

*Fueled by an inner fury, you can tap into the raw, untamed power coursing through you. As you enter a state of rage, your senses sharpen, and a ferocious determination takes hold. Stripped of armor, you become a living tempest, deflecting incoming attacks with sheer might.*

# Upgrades
When you are selecting a boon, you can instead choose one of the following upgrades, provided you have previously taken [Rage](Rage.md)

## Aspect of the Storm
While raging, the area around you (2 tile radius) becomes stormy, based on a harsh and unforgiving environment, and all speed in this radius is halved (excluding yours). You can spend a stamina point to deal damage equal to the successes of a strength check. The type of this damage is selected from the **elemental** damage types when you select this boon, and can be changed immediately after a rest.

*Your rage warps the area immediately around you, transforming the ground and air into a harsh and unforgiving environment. It may become blisteringly hot like a desert, stormy like the sea, or biting cold like the tundra.*
