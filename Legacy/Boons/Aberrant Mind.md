A number of times equal to your Strength score (per rest), you can extend your reach with an otherworldly force. At a point you can see within 12 tiles, you cause a spectral form to appear, which you can make a physical attack with, spending a stamina as normal.

The spectral form has zero in every primary attribute except for Strength, in which it has a value which matches yours. It has a melee reach of 2 tiles, 0 speed, and has 1 heart.

_The Aberrant Mind is a manifestation of the uncanny ties you possess to realms beyond. With an otherworldly force in the form of a spectral tentacle (or whatever form best represents the source of your power), you can project your presence beyond the mere limits of your physical form._

## The Fathomless
From your spectral summoning, you can cast spells and use abilities. Additionally, you can spend focus points when you summon it. This increases the amount of heart that the spectral form has, being 1 plus the focus spent.

_As your Aberrant Mind delves deeper into the unknown, your spectral manifestation evolves into a durable conduit for your eldritch powers. With your strengthened connection to the greater cosmos, you become a formidable force to be reckoned with._
