When wearing light or no armor, you may use dexterity for damage rolls with light or medium melee weapons, and may also spend **one Focus** to impose disadvantage on attack rolls against you by a creature within melee range.

_Mastering the art of dueling, you weave through battle with agile precision, your dexterity infusing each strike with deadly finesse. As adversaries close in, your focus sharpens, allowing you to anticipate and deflect their attacks, turning each duel into a choreographed dance of swift strikes and evasive maneuvers._
