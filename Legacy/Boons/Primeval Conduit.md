When you are attacked with an elemental damage type, you may spend **one Stamina** to impose disadvantage, as you absorb some of the energy. On your next turn, you may spend **one Focus** to unleash this energy, dealing damage equal to the successes of a **Constitution Check** to a creature within one tile, with the type being the same as the original attack.

*When elemental fury strikes, you channel that force of creation and destruction, prepared to deliver some of that wrath back towards your attacker. As a vessel of primordial energy, you unleash its fury upon those who challenge it.*

# Upgrades
When you are selecting a boon, you can instead choose one of the following upgrades, provided you have previously taken [Primeval Conduit](Primeval%20Conduit.md)

## Primordial Mastery
Each rest, you may choose an elemental damage type. Attacks of this type all have disadvantage against you, and you do not have to spend **Stamina** to charge your Primeval Conduit ability when this happens.

*Your body adapts to the ever-changing conditions you find yourself in, allowing you to effortlessly wield the essence of nature's wrath. Your elemental fury becomes even more ingrained to your being, resisting it not being a conscious decision anymore.*
