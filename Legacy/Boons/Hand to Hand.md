# [Hand to Hand](Hand%20to%20Hand.md)
Your unarmed strikes (punches, kicks, etc) are considered to be light melee weapons, and can be attacked with by spending a **focus point** rather than stamina. Additionally, any creatures grappled by you take R2 bludgeoning damage at the start of your turn, rolled at advantage.

*You have honed your body into a lethal weapon, capable of delivering flurried strikes to break down enemies' resolves. Your mental focus on these strikes set you apart from other fighters, leaving your enemies reeling from your martial mastery.*

# Upgrades

## Stunning Strike
By perfecting where you hit an enemy, you can turn your opponent's body against them. When you reduce another creature's heart with an unarmed strike, you can spend a focus point to attempt to stun them. The target makes a **Constitution Check** against the damage they took, and if failed, they are stunned until the end of your next turn. (Stunned: 0 Speed, and cannot spend stamina or focus)

*The pinnacle of your martial training, you can harness your mental and physical discipline by striking with precision and accuracy, incapacitating your enemies with a single blow. Unable to defend themselves against your onslaught, you assert your dominance on the battlefield, rendering your foes powerless in the face of your martial prowess.*
