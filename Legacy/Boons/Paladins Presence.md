When you make a melee attack against a creature, you can expend **Focus** points to deal additional celestial damage. Choose the type of celestial damage when you select this boon, as it cannot be changed later. You deal an additional R2 of this damage type for each Focus point you spend.

*Imbued with the divine essence, your strikes carry the celestial fervor of a defender of unwavering ideals, or chosen by powerful beings. With each swing, celestial power courses through your weapon, a manifestation of your indomitable conviction and the divine strength that fortifies your every blow. As a harbinger of celestial retribution, your martial prowess becomes a beacon of unwavering determination on the battlefield.*
