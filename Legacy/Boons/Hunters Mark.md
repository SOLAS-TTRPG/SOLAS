# [Hunters Mark](Hunters%20Mark.md)
When you reduce a creature's heart with a physical attack, you can spend a focus point to forge a bond based on your keen perception and mental acuity: it is marked. When you physically attack the marked creature again, add additional dice to the roll based on your **Mind Score**, and the mark vanishes.

*The Hunter's Mark is a valuable piece of information gleaned by damaging an enemy, by seeing how your next attack against it could be improved. With the vulnerabilities of the enemy exposed, you are able to unleash greater harm against your marked adversary.*

# Upgrades
When you are selecting a boon, you can instead choose one of the following upgrades, provided you have previously taken [Hunters Mark](Hunters%20Mark.md)

## Blood Hunter
You've learned occult rituals that twist the ways of normal arcane to help you combat your targets. When you mark a creature, you can choose to sacrifice R1 heart to strengthen the bond between you, selecting one of the following effects:

- **Binding Curse**. When you attack a marked creature, they must make a **Strength Check** against the damage they received. If they fail, their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of your next turn.
- **Crimson Brand**. If a marked creature is within melee range of you and attacks you or an ally, you can expend any number of **Focus** points you currently have. You roll a number of dice equal to the focus points you expended, the successes being damage to the creature of your mark's type.

You choose an elemental or celestial damage type for the nature of the bond when you select this boon.

_Through forbidden rites, you enhance your Hunter's Mark, turning the tide of battle by imposing curses and unleashing arcane brands upon your adversaries._

## Rogue Agent
You have mastered the art of capitalizing on an enemy's moment of vulnerability. When you have advantage on an attack against a creature, you can spend **one Focus** to roll additional dice equal to your **Mind** score as part of the damage. You do not need advantage to roll the additional dice if there is another enemy of the target within 1 tile of it.

_With a strategic mind and lightning reflexes, you exploit opportunities effortlessly. Whether through advantage or the proximity of other foes, your attacks become a symphony of calculated strikes, leaving enemies reeling from your tactical prowess._
