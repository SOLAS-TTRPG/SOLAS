# [Alchemical Craft](Alchemical%20Craft.md)
During a rest, you can produce one experimental elixir in an empty flask that you touch. A creature can drink this, requiring one stamina point. You may only have a number of elixirs equal to your **Constitution** score, and only one can be produced per rest.

- **Healing Concoction** The drinker regains heart, equal to the successes of a **Mind** you make.
- **Neutralizing Concoction** The drinker gains a damage buffer against an elemental damage type of your choice, the buffer being equal to your **Mind Score**
