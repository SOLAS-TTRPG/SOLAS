**Scalable: +R2 Poison**
Range: Three Tiles
Damage: R3 Poison

You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. A creature targeted by this makes a **constitution check** against the damage taken: if it fails, it takes R3 Poison on the start of your next turn.
