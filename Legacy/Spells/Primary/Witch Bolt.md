***Concentration***
**Scalable: +R2 Lightning**
Range: 6 Tiles
Damage: R3 Lightning

A beam of crackling energy lances out towards a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. If the target's heart is reduced, the arc stays connected. On each of your following turns until you lose **concentration** or the target leaves range, you can spend **one stamina** to deal damage to the target with no focus cost (subsequent damage is not **scaled**).
