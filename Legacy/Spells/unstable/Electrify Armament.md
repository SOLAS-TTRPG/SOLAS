You wrap your weapon in crackling electricity. Half of the dice you roll for an attack (rounded down) are now lightning damage. Additionally, if the target is wearing metal armor, the lightning damage dice are rolled with advantage.

*Your weapon is transformed into a conduit of electricity, the air humming around you like before a thunderstorm. It arcs toward your target as you attack, converting some of your physical force into a miniature lightning storm.*
