# Preface
The main goals of Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs) are to provide exploration, social interaction, and combat for a group with a common interest in storytelling.

Some TTRPGs make this overly cumbersome with tons of rolling, rules with caveat rules, and systems that might work mechanically but don't make sense. Barrier to entry is just way too high for most, whether in complexity, cost, or both.

SOLAS is an attempt to correct these issues in larger systems by providing an extremely pick-up-and-playable rule set that even players who are unfamiliar with TTRPGs can learn quickly. The goal is to provide a dead-simple system that allows for quick understanding of available options, while providing room for diving in and getting creative.

# About the Creator
I got introduced to TTRPGs with Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (copyright Hasbro), and was totally captured by it. Over time I branched out to 5e, and got inspired to run my own campaigns from T.I.M.E. Stories (copyright Space Cowboys) and Call of Cthulu (copyright Chaosium). After seeing straightforward aspects of other systems that still allowed for player freedom and creativity, I started running my own campaigns and one shots with my own system: something lighter to fit me and my player's needs (less crunchy and better customization).

And that's where we are today! Thanks for checking it out.

# Thanks
Thanks to all of my friends who I shoveled this system onto, just to change rules a couple months later. Sorry for the headaches, but hopefully the fun stories outweighed them.

Huge thanks to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for the amazing piece of software, this would be impossible to create and maintain without it. I'm unaffiliated but still, thanks.
