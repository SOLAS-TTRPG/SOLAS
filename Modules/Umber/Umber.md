# [Umber](Umber.md)
**An Ancient World, Worn by Time**

In Umber, the echoes of ancient empires and forgotten gods linger beneath ruins and cities alike. Most people have some sort of magical tendency, but deep study leads to suspicion of and from others. Adventurers are common, but most treat it as an income stream rather than grand, altruistic quests. In a world scarred by the passage of time, old twisted ruins of the past stand as reminders that even the greatest ideals can falter.

With expanded character abilities and spells, Umber lends a focus to personal stories, striking a balance between high fantasy and sword and sorcery.

# Mechanics
Characters are created using the standard SOLAS method. However, there are a few new options to keep in mind when doing so: Races, Spellcasting, and additional abilities called Boons.

## Races
You can choose this at any point of the character creation process. Whether you think of a character first and then create the stats around them or vice versa, here are your options:

**Humans.** WIP

**Dwarves.** One of the oldest races (in terms of history), live primarily underground, where their steady improvement of metalworking... WIP

**Elves.** WIP

**Faunari.** Nomadic folk with hooved goat legs, permitting them navigation of difficult terrain from steep mountains to forest undergrowth. They sport horns that range from swept-back antelope to large, curling ram shapes. Their varied skin pigmentation comes from the environments they were born in, from ashen gray hues in mountains, to fiery red in deserts, deep green in forests, even pure white in tundras. The Faunari form roaming kin-clans that can create temporary settlements, or _Glens_,  at common crossroad areas where they trade, celebrate, and share stories as the population is ever arriving, ever leaving.

**Chlorophytes.** Coming in both small and large sizes, these green-skinned humanoids are more commonly described as goblins and/or orcs. Due to their ability to absorb sunlight to survive almost indefinitely without rations, they have both developed vastly different cultures than most other humanoids, and each other. Orcs (somewhat tall, with small tusks and ranging from lithe to muscular) have taken to living in forests, swamps, or jungles, where they will build canopy bridge-networked towns. Goblins (heavyset, four feet tall, and floppy-eared) have built culture revolving around outdoor relaxation and festivals, with them settling near bodies of water.

## Spells
There is magic out the world, and some have the ability to control it. As for you (if you have a Mind score of at least two), you have this gift. Spells and arcane prowess are generally controlled by your character's **Mind** ability.

Characters can have a certain amount of prepared spells equal to their Mind. Most spellcasters have some way of keeping track of the spells they've encountered and learned, but due to the immense mental strain can only have a few ready at any given moment. The spells you have prepared are the ones that you can cast.

Spells have a certain cost, being **one stamina** as well as a **focus cost**.

## Boons
As your character becomes more experienced in what they do, they can specialize in how they approach challenges. **When your character reaches level two** (don't forget to put a point into one of your abilities) you can select a boon, as long as you meet the ability minimum. You get to select an additional boon (or an upgrade to one that you have) every three levels after this. That means levels 2, 5, 8, 11, and so on. There isn't a maximum level.
