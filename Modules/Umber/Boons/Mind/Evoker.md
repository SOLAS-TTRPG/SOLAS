# Upgrades
When you reach a level where you can select a new boon, you can instead opt to take one of the upgrades below. Upgrades are not exclusive.

## Draconic Evoker
When you select this boon upgrade, choose an elemental damage type (Acid, Poison, Fire, Cold, Lightning). When you roll this damage type against a target, you roll with advantage. If an enemy rolls this damage type against you, they have disadvantage. You cannot change this type once you've selected the upgrade.

## Cosmic Evoker
When you select this boon upgrade, choose a celestial damage type (Radiant, Necrotic, Force, Psychic). When you roll this damage type against a target, you roll with advantage. If an enemy rolls this damage type against you, they have disadvantage. You cannot change this type once you've selected the upgrade.

# Spells
The [Evoker](Evoker.md) Spell List is as follows:

## Apprentice Spells
**Requires Two Mind | Costs Two Focus**

## Fear
A number of targets (up to your Strength) of your choice within close range are frightened of you. There are three options they can take: fight, flight, or freeze. Fight locks them into moving towards you, and they are forced to attack. Flight locks them into moving away from you, no attacks against you. Freeze completely locks their movement, but they cannot use any actions on their turn.

## Telekinesis
You can apply a push or pull force within short range. By spending **one focus and one stamina**, you can move a target up to 5 feet per success of a strength check. If the target attempts to resist it, they roll a strength check which reduces your successes.
